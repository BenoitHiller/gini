Three python files--server_v4, gini_v4 and real_v4 are included.

server_v4 is responsible for collecting the ip address and port from the real machine, sending these information to the gini frontend.
On the other hand, upon receiving the gini ip and mac from gini frontend, server_v4 delivers this to the real machine.

gini_v4 and real_v4 are simple test programs which emulate gini frontend and real machine interfaces.
