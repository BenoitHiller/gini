GINI Toolkit Version 1.0

Basic Installation
==================

To install GINI, you need the following libraries and applications:

    Libreadline 5.0 or up (plus development files)
    Libslack
    Pyro 3.7 or up
    Python 2.5 or up (plus development files)
    Python-tk 2.5 or up
    Python-xml 0.8 or up
    Screen 4.0 or up
    UML-utilities

Install each of these libraries, either through a package manager or
from source.  Libslack and Pyro are unavailable on most, if not all, package 
managers, and must be installed from source.  They are available
at http://libslack.org/ and http://pyro.sourceforge.net/, respectively.

Once the libraries are installed, you must set the GINI_HOME environment 
variable to the location of your installation.  It is best to create
a separate directory, called "gini", where the GINI files will be installed.

Create a "gini" directory in your home directory:

    mkdir $HOME/gini

Edit the .profile or .bashrc file in your home directory and add the following:

    export GINI_HOME=$HOME/gini
    export PATH=$PATH:$GINI_HOME/bin

This sets the GINI_HOME environment variable to your desired path, and
adds the bin directory within GINI_HOME to your PATH variable.

To enable the new profile settings, run the following:

    source $HOME/.profile

Now we are ready to configure and install GINI.  Assuming you have downloaded
the GINI source code, you can uncompress it using tar:

    tar xvf gini-VERSION.tar.gz

Where VERSION is the version number of your downloaded source code.
Before installing, you must run the following command to configure 
pyXML:

    `echo 'oldxml' > /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/oldxml.pth`

Within the gini-VERSION directory, run the following:

    ./configure --prefix=$GINI_HOME
    make
    make install
