gRouter
=======
* Clean up the CLI. The way CLI is parsing the command line is really bad!
  This should be cleaned up and made more modular and easy to extend. What
  is the best way without writing a full blown scanner?

* Implement packet filters: This is to implement router-level access control.

* Implement more ICMP packet support. How about router solicitations and
  advertisements?

* Check other ICMP packet types.

* Check the necessity for UDP and TCP. We need them to implement routing 
  protocols. These can be given as student assignments as well.



gBuilder
=======
* Project option -- this is essential for the students to build on
  previous work.
